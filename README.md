# BuildLink

**Automated milestone-based escrow for construction — powered by smart contracts.**

BuildLink eliminates payment delays, retainage disputes, and administrative overhead in real estate development by replacing manual processes with programmable financial infrastructure on-chain.

---

## The Problem

In construction and real estate development, getting paid is slow and unreliable:

- Milestone payments require manual approvals, inspections, and sign-offs
- Retainage is held arbitrarily and released late — or disputed
- No transparency between developers, contractors, and lenders
- Cash flow instability forces contractors to finance their own work

There is no programmable infrastructure connecting real-world construction milestones to automated financial execution.

---

## The Solution

BuildLink locks project funds in a smart contract escrow. Payments are released automatically when milestone conditions are met — with reduced delays, faster execution, and a full on-chain audit trail.

- Developer deposits funds into the escrow vault
- Contractor submits proof of completion (hash of inspection, delivery, sign-off)
- Developer approves the milestone
- Funds are released on-chain upon approval
- Retainage is held automatically and released at project closeout

## Live Demo — Base Mainnet

### 2026-04-11 — Full oracle loop with automatic payment (Phase 2)

| Step | Transaction |
|---|---|
| sendRequest() called | [0xc90b7755...](https://basescan.org/tx/0xc90b77552e20858de1ea2ad2f0533fd79a94e2ebaa799212a1bb8c91be2b4c55) |

## How It Works

### ETH flow
```
Developer creates project → EscrowFactory deploys EscrowVault
Developer funds vault → ETH locked in escrow
Developer creates milestones → Contractor gets to work
Contractor submits proof hash → Developer reviews and approves
Developer pays milestone → Net amount released, retainage held
80% of milestones PAID (DISPUTED milestones excluded) → Developer releases retainage
```

### USDC flow
```
Developer creates project → EscrowFactoryUSDC deploys EscrowVaultUSDC
Developer approves USDC spend → Developer calls depositFunds()
Developer creates milestones → Contractor gets to work
Contractor submits proof hash → Developer reviews and approves
Developer pays milestone → USDC released, retainage held
80% of milestones PAID (DISPUTED milestones excluded) → Developer releases retainage in USDC
```

## Architecture

```
ETH System
──────────
EscrowFactory.sol
└── Deploys one EscrowVault per project

EscrowVault.sol
└── Milestone state machine: NONE → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → PAID → DISPUTED
└── Native ETH deposits via receive()
└── Retainage logic: held per milestone, released at closeout

USDC System
───────────
EscrowFactoryUSDC.sol
└── Deploys one EscrowVaultUSDC per project
└── USDC address set at factory deployment

EscrowVaultUSDC.sol
└── Mirrors EscrowVault logic using IERC20 (USDC, 6 decimals)
└── depositFunds(uint256) with ERC-20 transferFrom instead of receive()
└── Milestone state machine: NONE → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → PAID → DISPUTED
└── Retainage logic: held per milestone, released at closeout
└── Follows checks-effects-interactions

Shared
──────
BuildLinkFunctionsConsumer.sol
└── Live on Base Mainnet — real FunctionsClient, subscription 143, funded DON, wired to approveMilestone on EscrowVaultUSDC
```

## Milestone States

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| NONE | Milestone created, waiting for contractor |
| SUBMITTED | Contractor submitted proof hash |
| APPROVED | Developer approved, ready to pay |
| PAID | Payment released to contractor |
| DISPUTED | Developer disputed the submission |

## Frontend Features

Live at [buildlink-frontend.vercel.app](https://buildlink-frontend.vercel.app)

### Authentication
- **Privy integration** — email and SMS login for non-crypto users; embedded wallet created automatically on first login
- **Coinbase Smart Wallet** — biometric login on mobile (Face ID / fingerprint), no seed phrase required
- **RainbowKit** — MetaMask, WalletConnect, and all standard wallet connectors retained

### Developer UX
- Create ETH or USDC escrow projects from the dashboard
- Deposit USDC, create milestones, approve and release payments on-chain
- Shareable project link generated on creation — copy and send to contractor
- Dispute milestone with on-chain reason

### Contractor UX
- `/contractor` page — wallet-filtered view showing only assigned projects
- Submit milestone proof via text description; `keccak256` hash computed silently in the browser
- Post-submission confirmation message (plain English, auto-dismisses after 10 seconds)
- Re-submit after dispute

### Public Dashboard
- `/explore` — all USDC projects visible without wallet connection
- Project cards show deposited amount, milestones, retainage %, creation date

### Oracle Integration
- Chainlink Functions oracle loop proven end-to-end on Base Mainnet (2026-04-11)
- `approveMilestone` + `payMilestone` execute atomically from `fulfillRequest` — no off-chain listener required
- USDC transferred to contractor automatically upon DON fulfillment

---

## Vision

BuildLink is the financial infrastructure layer for construction:

- Automated retainage logic triggered by project completion
- Tokenized milestone financing for lenders
- On-chain disbursements augmenting and improving traditional payment systems
- Transparent payment flows for all stakeholders

---

## Why Chainlink

BuildLink uses Chainlink Functions to bridge real-world construction approvals with on-chain financial execution.

- **Secure verification of off-chain milestone approvals** — the Chainlink DON fetches and validates approval data from external systems before any payment logic executes
- **Trust-minimized execution of payments** — no single party controls the trigger; the oracle network enforces the condition
- **A scalable path to integrate real construction platforms like Procore** — the webhook interface is designed to accept HMAC-signed approval events from existing project management platforms

---

## Integration

BuildLink does not change how construction teams work — it improves how capital is executed within existing workflows.

It is not a replacement for Procore or Textura. It is a financial infrastructure layer that sits alongside them:

- **Procore / Textura** — Handle project data, SOV approvals, milestone documentation, and team workflows
- **Chainlink Functions** — Bridges off-chain approvals to on-chain execution via a trust-minimized oracle network
- **BuildLink Vault** — Executes programmable milestone payments on Base Mainnet with reduced delays, faster settlement, and a full audit trail

Webhook endpoint (conceptual): POST /api/procore/webhook
Chainlink Functions consumer: 0xAf82c9E5Dfc7c6380c2c0a3407de7f8030503c95
